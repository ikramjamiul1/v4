      <p>Hi Noor :)</p>
      <p>I didn’t realise I wanted to write you a letter till I realised that I wasn’t able to fully express how I feel about you in a text message. So I’m writing this letter for you and I’m worried it might sound cliche or cringey but with you I really don’t mind that.</p>
      <p>It’s been just over a month now since we’ve properly started speaking and honestly I wouldn’t change a thing about it. It’s weird with how timing works since we were kinda interweaved into each others live for the past two years, with my aunt and your brother, so it was really just a matter of time before we met. </p>
      <p>Noor I genuinely don’t know where or how this will continue but I really do need it to work cos even though you’ve been in my life for so short I genuinely couldn’t imagine it without you in it. I really do pray this works and we thrive. I like that we just make sense, we’re like two puzzle pieces that just fit with ease I don’t know how to explain it but it just feels so right. One of my favourite things will always be the way we show our love for each other. I never feel like I’m doing too much or too little for you cos you make me feel so appreciated and it’s something I’ve never had before you but I love it. And I hope you know there’s not a day that goes by without me appreciating everything about you. </p>  
      <p>I like that we have a similar story and are always on the same page. I really hope that we’re able to keep writing this story just together now. I like that we think the same way and care about the same things like our children’s assemblies and parents evenings. It’s the small things that are important to me and always will be. </p>  
      <p>I realise I could write forever but eventually this letter has gotta come to an end. But I pinky promise you I will always keep you a priority. I pinky promise I will try my hardest to make you laugh everyday. I pinky promise I will do my best to make you know how valuable you are. I could keep going but I might run out of stuff to pinky promise in the next love letters to come. </p>  
      <p>I think I’m gonna try end each letter with some that’s means a lot to me in that moment of my life.  And right now it’s probably this: ‘May you find someone who speaks your language, so you don’t have to spend a life time translating your soul’. I don’t think anyone speaks my soul better than you do and lucky for me it only took 20 years and not a lifetime.  </p>  
      <p>I really do like you Noor you are genuine perfection everything about you. Your laugh. Your smile. Those little crease near your lips when you make that smile. How your face scrunches up when you’re happy. I hate that people in your life have ever made you feel like you’re anything but perfect cos you really are. </p>  
      
      <p>From your jammy dodger :)<br>PS I cried whilst writing this for you.</p>

    <div class="slide">
      <p>Hi Noor,</p>
      <p>I’m writing this as I’m on the plane back and I really miss you dude. My eyes started watering and it made me realise you have this hold on me that really confuses me...</p>
      <p>I love you Noor. I love your scent. I love your childish giggle that makes me feel like it’s just us two in the whole world...</p>
      <p>From your little ray of sunshine that only shines for you :)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <p>Hi Noor :p</p>
      <p>I’m writing this whilst you’re sleeping with a couple days away from our third month...</p>
      <p>I love you my other half.<br>From the half that’s nothing without you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="slide">
      <p>Hi Noor &lt;3</p>
      <p>Happy six months baby girl… Now that I’m a little more grown up and I’m just looking back on everything I can really say I love you...</p>
      <p>I love you to the moon and back baby girl my Noor I really do.<br>From the boy who is eager to marry the girl who sits in front of her.</p>
