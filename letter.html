      Dear Noor,
    </div>

    <div class="letter-body">
I don’t even really know where to start, but I know I wanted this to feel like something you could hold in your hands, even if it’s on a screen.

Every time I think about you, it feels like my world gets a little quieter and a little brighter at the same time. Quieter because everything else fades out, and brighter because you somehow make even the ordinary feel special.

I love the way you make me feel understood without me having to explain everything. I love the comfort I feel when I think about you. It’s the kind of feeling that makes me smile for no reason and makes my chest feel warm in a way I can’t really explain.

You’ve become such a big part of my heart, and I don’t take that lightly. I’m grateful for you, for your laugh, for your smile, for the way you exist in my life. I don’t know what the future holds exactly, but I know that I want you in it.

More than anything, I just want you to know how loved you are. By me. Always.
