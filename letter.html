      Hi Noor,
    </div>

    <div class="letter-body">
It’s been just over 8 months and it’s coming up to Valentines Day so I thought I’d write you a letter. Of course why wouldn’t I. 

I love you baby I love everything about you. I love how far you’ve come and I’m so proud of everything about you. The scarf looks gorgeous on you and I know you don’t believe me but honestly you really are amazing. Your relationship with religion is something I admire, to me it came naturally growing up but to you it was different and to be able to try so hard to get here is commendable. 

I love you baby I love everything about you. I love going on dates with you and my favourite thing is watching films with you. It makes me feel like we’re in our own living room, cuddling on the sofa and watching a film. It’s a pretty nice life. 

I love you baby I love everything about you. I love that you understand and try your hardest to understand me. Whether it be about our money our arguement our life and future and careers I love that you try to understand me. 

I love you baby I love everything about you. I love how badly you want us. It makes me feel like less of a loser for loving you so much. It makes me feel seen when I do cringey things like create a whole website for how I see how relationship. 

I love you baby I love everything about you. I love looking at our future with you. Whether it be a date that’s in a couple of days or whether it be our home in a couple of months. Or our wedding that’s coming very soon ;)

I love you munchkin. And we always say more or mostest or anything to prove one loves each other more. But I feel like if you love me anywhere similar to how I love you then I must really be loved. 

I sit and I think sometimes how we get to have a whole life ahead of us and I think I couldn’t be more lucky to have someone I laugh with, I trust, I confide in. You really are me everything. I love you baby.

      I love you in a way I’ve never loved someone before.
